Ravi boarded the midnight train, his heart heavy with nostalgia. The rhythmic chug of the engine and the occasional whistle filled the quiet night. He settled into his window seat, watching the dimly lit platform fade into the distance.

The train snaked through the countryside, cutting through the darkness like a silver blade. Fields stretched endlessly, interrupted only by the occasional flicker of a distant village light. The hum of conversations, the rustling of newspapers, and the soft snores of sleeping passengers created a comforting symphony.

An old man sat across from him, sipping chai. “Where are you headed, son?” he asked.

“Back home,” Ravi smiled. “After ten years.”

The old man nodded knowingly. “Trains bring us back to where we belong.”

As the first light of dawn touched the horizon, the train slowed. Ravi’s heart pounded as he saw his hometown station come into view. Familiar sights welcomed him—his childhood memories rushing back. As the train stopped, he stepped onto the platform, inhaling the crisp morning air.

Some journeys aren’t just about reaching a destination. Sometimes, they bring us back to ourselves.
